# commons
Carpentries Commons is a place for open sharing of reusable material, such as text for grants, wording for job or tenure applications, slide decks for conferences, workshop descriptions, promotional copy, and so on.

Carpentries staff will have write access to add, edit and upload material here. Other members of our community will need to fork the reposiotry and submit pull requests.

Please use this repository to share Carpentries-related material that you have created that may be useful to others.
