------------

### What are the Carpentries?

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are non-profit volunteer organizations who teach essential computing and data skills. 
We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are not part of basic research training 
in most disciplines.

### About Software Carpentry     

Software Carpentry enables researchers to create purpose-built tools, whether it be a Unix shell script to automate 
repetitive tasks, or software code in programming languages such as Python, R, or MATLAB. 
These enable researchers to build programs that can be read, re-used, and validated, greatly enhancing the 
sharing and reproducibility of their research.    

### About Data Carpentry

Data Carpentry learners are taught to work with data more effectively. Workshops focus on the data lifecycle, covering data organization, cleaning and management  through to data analysis and visualization. Lessons are domain-specific, with coverage in biology, genomics, geospatial data, and social sciences.
