### Foundational Computational and Data Skills for Researchers

As data gets bigger and more and more research requires computation, your researchers need new skills. 
Many would like to work more efficiently, but don't know how. No pathway exists to help many graduate students and postdocs 
learn crucial computational and data science skills.

### This is a problem Software and Data Carpentry can fix.

We teach researchers foundational computing and data skills. We also help build local communities of practice around tools and disciplines.

### Why is that important?

Learning new skills is one thing. Embedding them is another.  It takes a supportive community to help people integrate new skills and make them part of daily practice.

### How do we help?

1. Software and Data Carpentry partner with institutions to build researcher capacity within your organisation. 
2. We run two-day workshops that introduce coding and coding best practice to researchers and teach them the basics of data science. 
3. We train new instructors for you so you get more workshops taught. 
4. We continue mentoring those instructors, who, with their learners, become the core of new communities around disciplines and tools.

### Benefits for your institution

- Your research training dollars are not wasted on workshops with poor ROI
- Research productivity is enhanced, leading to faster, more reliable results
- Researchers are taught the basics of reproducible science
- You help create and foster the research workforce you need
- Offering students training aids recruitment and enhances graduate outcomes
- Our instructor training program builds great teachers

### Who we are

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are non-profit volunteer organizations who teach essential computing and data skills. 
We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are not offered as basic research 
training in most universities or disciplines.

### Software and Data Carpentry offer

- Open source, community-developed lessons
- Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach
- A supportive learning culture
- Instructor training, mentoring and support
- Active global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct
- Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training metho
